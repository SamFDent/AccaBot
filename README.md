# AccaBot

A Twitter API application that collates the NAP football bets of the weekend and tweets out the results. Users can add their best bet of the weekend to a public Google Sheet. The bot then accesses the sheet via the Google Sheets API and collects, wrangles and organises the data ready for broadcast. The results are tweeted out periodically by the bot and Twitter users can request a betting tip by mentioning the bot's Twitter handle followed by a pre-defined hashtag e.g. #3ormore
The bot will respond on request to the user with the crowd sourced bet for that weekend
